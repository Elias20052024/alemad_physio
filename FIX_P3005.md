# Fix P3005 Error - Mark Migration as Applied

Your Neon database already has tables but Prisma doesn't know about them. Here's how to fix it:

## Option 1: Use Render Shell (Recommended)

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service
3. Click "Shell" tab
4. Run this command:
```bash
cd backend && npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251230_init
```

This tells Prisma: "The init migration was already applied, trust me"

5. Redeploy and it should work!

## Option 2: Manual SQL on Neon

If Option 1 doesn't work, run this SQL directly in Neon:

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Run this command:
```sql
INSERT INTO "_prisma_migrations" (id, checksum, finished_at, migration_name, logs, rolled_back_at, started_at, applied_steps_count)
VALUES (
  '20251230_init_baseline',
  'checksum_placeholder',
  NOW(),
  '20251230_init',
  '',
  NULL,
  NOW(),
  1
);
```

4. Go back to Render and redeploy

## What This Does

Prisma tracks applied migrations in a `_prisma_migrations` table. By adding this record, you're telling Prisma:
- ✅ The init migration has been applied
- ✅ The database is in sync with migrations
- ✅ Don't try to apply it again

## After This Works

1. Your database will have all tables
2. You can seed it with `npm run seed` (if you add that script)
3. API will connect to data successfully
